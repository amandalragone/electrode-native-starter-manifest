### Plugins (native modules) injection configuration directory

This directory should contain native modules configurations.

If you need more details on how to structure this directory and how to write injection configuration for native modules, you can have a look to our documentation on [reusing existing native modules].  

You can also have a look to [Electrode React Native Master Manifest] repository.
